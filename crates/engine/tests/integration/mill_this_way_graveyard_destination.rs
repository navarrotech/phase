//! CR 614.6 + CR 701.17c: a "put into a graveyard this way" consumer counts
//! only the milled cards that ACTUALLY arrived in a graveyard.
//!
//! A mill batch is published to the tracked set including the cards a
//! replacement (Rest in Peace, Leyline of the Void) sent to public exile
//! instead, because an effect that refers to a milled card finds it in the
//! public zone it went to (CR 701.17c — Locke's "cast a spell from among those
//! cards"). The destination-NAMED consumers are different: CR 614.6 says a
//! replaced event never happens, so a card exiled instead was never "put into a
//! graveyard", and the count must not include it.
//!
//! Oracle text below is verbatim from Scryfall `cards/named`.
